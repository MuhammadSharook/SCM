 # Supply Chain Management System

This repository houses the code for a unified supply chain management system designed to streamline operations from order placement to delivery. The system integrates three core modules: Order Management System (OMS), Transportation Management System (TMS), and Distribution Management System (DMS).

## System Overview
The goal of this system is to create a seamless and efficient supply chain ecosystem by:

Integrating data across all modules for real-time visibility and decision-making.
Automating key processes such as order fulfillment, route optimization, and inventory management.
Improving communication between stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and carriers.
### Modules and Functions
### 1. Order Management System (OMS)
Capture and validate customer orders from multiple channels (online, in-store, mobile apps).

Manage order fulfillment by assigning orders to appropriate warehouses and carriers.

### 2. Transportation Management System (TMS)
Optimize delivery routes considering distance, traffic, and delivery windows.
Manage relationships with third-party logistics providers and carriers.
Track shipments.

### 3. Distribution Management System (DMS)
Oversee warehouse operations including storage, picking, packing, and shipping.
Track inventory levels across multiple warehouses.
Forecast future inventory needs based on historical data.
Manage product returns and restocking efficiently.
